# Reflection ✨


In this PC laboratory, we learned how to assemble a PC. 
During the disassembly process, we were very careful in removing each component (such as RAM, hard disk, power support, and others). 
What impressed me the most was that when connecting the wires, even if just one connection was incorrect, it would cause the PC to fail to start. 
Finally, through our efforts, the PC was successfully powered on. This experiment is crucial for us to remember all the components in the PC.
